/// Class to hold a "transferable" list of automatically deleted pointers to
/// dynamically allocated objects.
///
/// The qtTransferablePointerArray class stores a dynamic list of pointers to
/// dynamically allocated objects, and deletes them when the reference goes out
/// of scope. It is a conceptual extension of qtTransferablePointer to a list
/// of pointers rather than a single pointer.
///
/// qtTransferablePointerArray is similar to a list of QScopedPointer's, with
/// the addition of a "transferable" property. Making a copy of a mutable
/// qtTransferablePointerArray "transfers" ownership of the objects to the new
/// qtTransferablePointerArray instance. This property allows dynamically
/// allocated objects to be safely passed to a single receiver across threads,
/// without the overhead of using an atomically reference-counted pointer like
/// QSharedPointer. Using a qtTransferablePointerArray ensures that the objects
/// will still be deleted if the receiving method never executes (e.g. because
/// its event loop is no longer executing).
///
/// When declaring a qtTransferablePointerArray, an optional \p Cleanup functor
/// may be specified. This must be a class or struct having a method
/// \c cleanup(\c T*) which is invoked to destroy each object. The default
/// functor simply invokes <code>operator delete</code> on each object.
///
/// \note In order to support transference via Qt queued method invocation
///       (i.e. QMetaObject::invokeMethod), qtTransferablePointerArray allows
///       Qt's metatype system to access its standard copy constructor, which
///       violates const-correctness by modifying the source instance. The
///       public "transfer" constructor correctly takes a mutable reference to
///       the source instance.
///
/// \par Thread Safety:
/// qtTransferablePointerArray is reentrant, but not generally thread safe.
/// Using qtTransferablePointerArray to pass a list of object pointers to
/// another thread is safe, provided that the underlying object is not accessed
/// by the original thread once it has been handed off, and that the
/// qtTransferablePointerArray seen by the receiving thread is not accessed in
/// any way (again, by the original thread) once it becomes visible to the
/// receiving thread.
