///
/// \deprecated
///   Since C++11, initialization of statics is required to be thread safe,
///   but Visual Studio did not implement this until VS 2015. Since we now

/// Declare a private singleton.
///
/// This macro declares a private singleton instance. Unlike a global variable
/// that merely has static duration, the singleton is not created until a
/// request for it is made. Upon such request, the singleton is created in a
/// thread-safe manner; that is, it is guaranteed that the accessor function
/// will return the same instance when called from multiple threads
/// simultaneously. The singleton will be destroyed in an unspecified order
/// when your application or library unloads.
///
/// The singleton accessor function is private to the execution unit in which
/// the singleton is declared.
///
/// \param type
///   The typename of the singleton. The return type of the accessor will be
///   \c type*. Note that \p type must not contain commas; use a typedef if you
///   need to declare a singleton of a template type taking more than one
///   template argument.
/// \param name Name of the accessor function.
///
/// \note You should only use this macro if your singleton needs global scope.
///       Singletons with function-local scope should just declare a static
///       variable instead, which (since C++11) has the same semantics.
///
/// \note Since C++11, it is guaranteed that the singleton will only be
///       constructed once. If multiple threads try to simultaneously access
///       the not-yet-created singleton, one thread will be chosen to complete
///       the initialization while the other threads block.
///
/// \par Example:
/// \code{.cpp}
/// class MySingleton
/// {
/// public:
///     void greet() { qDebug() << "Hello, world!"; }
/// };
